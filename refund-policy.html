          <p class="content">ProductX is a subscription based community that offers a suite of value added services
            to it’s members such as access to mentors with rates listed as free, access to the help request feature, and
            access to a private Slack community. Subscriptions are to be associated to a single person and cannot be
            shared with others. Sharing ProductX services with a non-registered person will result in a suspension of
            services. The pricing of our services may change, at any time without prior notice and at our discretion. We
            shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or
            discontinuance of our services.</p>

        <h4 class="heading">Fees for Mentors</h4>
        <p class="content">
          The amount due and payable to a mentor is agreed between the mentor and us at the start of our cooperation and
          prior to a mentor being listed on our website. These fees will be listed on the website, and quoted as in the
          session length listed (15 min, 30 min or 60 min). We will collect a percentage of the mentor fee directly from
          the payment received from the mentee and remit the remaining monies to the mentor. Our current fee for mentors
          is 15%. Service Fees are non-refundable. In case of any changes to our fees or methods of payment, we will
          notify you in writing prior to effecting any changes.
        </p>


        <h4 class="heading">Fees for Mentees</h4>
        <p class="content">
          You undertake to pay the fees charged to you for completed sessions. Once a session is booked, we or our
          authorized third party payment processor will collect the fees payable. In order to process your payment, you
          will be asked for billing information including name, billing address and your credit card details. We will
          ensure that in case payments are processed by a third party these are via a secure payment method. Please note
          that where transactions are undertaken by a third party processor the terms and conditions and privacy policy
          which apply to the processors services will be applicable to your transaction. Please review the third
          parties’
          terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. You must also check if your credit card
          provider charges fees related to the payment of these services. We disclaim liability for credit card
          processing
          transactions charged to you by your provider. You agree to provide current, complete and accurate billing
          information, including your email address, credit card number and expiration date, so that we can complete
          your
          transactions and contact you as needed. At the booking of a session you authorize us to charge your credit
          card
          to collect the fees listed in relation to your selected Mentor on our website. If you do not attend a paid
          call
          and the mentor was present, this session will count as completed
        </p>


        <h4 class="heading">Refunds</h4>
        <p class="content">
          Refunds are possible within 14 days of the start of membership when no call has been scheduled in the system.
          Refund possibilities are forfeited when a call with a mentor is requested and accepted within the platform or
          the direct messaging function has been used to solicit advice from mentors or connect outside of the platform.
